title: Using Secrets in Kubernetes
teaser: Secrets are a Kubernetes resource where you can store sensitive key value pairs.
description: |-
  Secrets are a Kubernetes resource where you can store sensitive key value pairs. 
  These can be exposed to a pod as an environment variable or mounted as a file, like configmaps, while obfuscating its contents within the cluster.

  title: Create a Secret
  teaser: Create your first secret on Kubernetes.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Secrets are a **resource** containing keys with **base64** encoded values.

      These values can be exposed to pods as **environment variables** or mounted as **files**.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      In order to create a secret from a file, you can run the following.
      ```
      echo -n "yourvalue" > ./secret.txt

      kubectl create secret generic secretname --from-file=./secret.txt
      ```
      This automatically encodes the value as **base64**
  assignment: |-
    Create a secret named **password** from a file containing the value **MyPassword1!** by using **kubectl**.
    
    Be sure to:
    - Pass **-n** to the echo command to make sure a newline isn't encoded along with your password.
    
    You can check if everything is working correctly by **refreshing the Kubernetes tab** and checking the secrets.
    If you need more help, try **kubectl create secret --help**.

  title: Create a Secret from a definition file
  teaser: This time, we're creating a secret from a YAML definition
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Like other resources, secrets can be defined using **YAML** or **JSON** files.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Note that when using a definition file, the values will already have to be **base64 encoded**

      To encode a string as base64, run
      ```
      echo -n "yourvalue" |base64
      ```
      The **-n** flag is important as it makes sure a newline isn't encoded along with your value.
      Newlines in passwords can prevent applications from authenticating.
  assignment: |-
    We have created a secret definition for you in **secret.yml**
    
    Edit **secret.yml** and add the **base64** encoded value of **NewPassword2!**
    Make sure to not include newline characters.
    
    Then create the secret using **kubectl**
